# Spring-MVC-Website

Repository consists of In-Class Assignments along with Questions.

Final_Project_Real_Estate_Website is a full stack website designed by me using the Spring MVC framework and Hibernate ORM. Some of the features of this website are as follows:

1.Person can create his/her account and can become a seller, agent or buyer. Validations for the user registration form included checking the database if the username is available or not along with empty field and incorrect value validations.
2.Seller can post a listing for sell on the website and can also maintain his/her own profile to check if any buyer has requested for a showing of the listing.
3.Buyer can see the listings on the website without Login in but he can only make a request for the property after creating an account on his/her name or by Login.
4.Seller can also choose to sell his/her listing via an agent thus the website also allows an agent to register himself who can also maintain his own profile.

Technologies Used:
Spring MVC framework, Hibernate ORM, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Jquery, Javascript, AngularJS, ReactJS, AJAX, Spring Security, MYSQL, Concepts of Springframework like Internationalisation and Localization, Interceptors, Annotation Based Controller and Mapping to the Database.
